# chart_stock_market

Freecodecamp Backend Project.

This project requires that a user can add a stock and the update is synced across all clients.

The app uses firebase add/remove child listeners which are based on websockets.

The app is preloaded with a list of stocks listed in NYSE and NASDAQ.

Users can search for a stock by typing in the search bar. Alphaadvantage API returns the data for the past 100 days.

The chart is updated with data points as the users add or remove stocks in realtime.
